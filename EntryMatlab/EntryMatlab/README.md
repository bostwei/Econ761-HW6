step 
* fixed set of random draws u_i for each market
* Frequency Estimator 
    - for each market, independent draws from the distribution of structure error
        (u_i0 u_i1 ... u_iK) u_i0 is the market shock
    - for firm k, simutate the estimator of firm pi_hat
    - n_hat is defined as the largest interger n such tat at lease n firm are profitable in n-firm equilibrium

    - Take 

Find the parameter makes the SSR small * grid search
